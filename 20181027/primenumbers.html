<!-- Loop through 1 to 1000
    7 % 2 = remainder
    from 2 to n-1

    if any of the 2 to n-1 have a factorial then it is not prime

-*** From Tom's notes:
For loop from 1 to 1000
where index = index
For loop from 2 to index -1
Check if modulus of 2 to index -1
If no remainder it is not a prime number.
